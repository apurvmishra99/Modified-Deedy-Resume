Modified-Deedy-Resume
=========================

Few tweaks to the original Deedy-Resume template.

## Changelog
### v0.0.1
- Shift the ordering of the columns
- Shifted education to the column with Experience.
- Changed ordering of items based on personal taste.

1. **MacFonts** - uses fonts native to OSX - *Helvetica*, *Helvetica Neue* (and it's Light and Ultralight versions) and the CJK fonts *Heiti SC*, and *Heiti TC*. The EULA of these fonts prevents distribution on Open Source.
2. **OpenFonts** - uses free, open-source fonts that resemble the above - *Lato* (and its various variants) and *Raleway*.
